# Project Structure

The driver code of the project is in the main.py file. At the end of the file, one can choose between running the "main" function that trains and tests several models and finally computes the predictions for year 10, as well as testing them, or the "predict_11th_year" function that predicts the outcome of the 11th season.
The functions in this file are the ones responsible for feature engineering, data cleaning, data processing, and data preparation.
The code located in the "models.py" file is responsible for training and testing the different Machine Learning models and it is called from the main module.
We also created a CustomCrossValidator that implements our sliding window logic, as described in the annexes of the presentation.
Finally, in the "analysis.py" module, we developed code that generated plots that we used for the presentation.

To make evaluation easier, we already provide the "models" directory that contains all the pre trained models.


Regarding the flow of the project, we first predict the performance of the players of each team, then we use that information to predict the team's overall performance and finally, having that performance in mind, we predict whether the team will be qualified for the playoffs or not.

In the data_reports folder, one can find the data reports generated by Ydata Profiling about the source data that the teachers provided us and that we used for developing the project.

In the root of the submission, we also present the csv files that contain the results of testing all the models we used in the project.
